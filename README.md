#  Diabetes Prediction Model Using Binary Classification

NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.

The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. 

# Objective

- The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

- Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.



## Installing required libraries

1. import numpy as np
2. import pandas as pd
3. import seaborn as sns
4. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
5. %matplotlib inline

#### Content

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: Serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
